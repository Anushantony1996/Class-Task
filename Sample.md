# Brain-Computer Interface
## INTRODUCTION 

**Brain-computer interface (BCI)** technology is a powerful communication tool
between users and systems. It does not require any external devices or muscle
intervention to issue commands and complete the interaction.

The research community has initially developed BCIs with biomedical applications in mind,
leading to the generation of assistive devices.
